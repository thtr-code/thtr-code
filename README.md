## Hey 👋 
I’m a Computer Engineering student who likes working on projects at the intersection of  
**coding, data, and systems**.


## Projects

Here are a few things I’ve worked on (or am actively working on):

**BlackholeSim**  
A real-time C++ / OpenGL N-body gravity simulation with grid warping and camera controls.  
https://github.com/thtr-code/PhysicsSimCPP
  
**Diabetes Readmission Analysis**  
Exploratory data analysis + ML modeling using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn on clinical data.  
https://github.com/thtr-code/diabetes-readmission-SQLite

**NBA Data Analysis**  
Pandas-based analysis of NBA data with regression, correlation, and data visualization.  
https://github.com/thtr-code/pandas-nba-3pt-analysis

<!--
**thtr-code/thtr-code** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
